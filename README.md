### Data Used

housing_per_year.csv
* While this dataset is included in the file, it is not used in the housing analysis.

neighborhoods_coordinates.csv
* This dataset shows the coordinates for neighborhoods in the San Francisco region 

sfo_neighborhoods_consensus_data.csv
* This dataset shows the housing sales data from 2010-2016 for the San Francisco region including the name of the neighborhood, sale_price_sqr_foot, housing_units, and gross_rent.

### Objective
The objective of this challenge was to use my data visualization skills to identify properties in the San Francisco market that are likely to be profitable investments. I used a variety of techniques, including aggregation, interactive visualizations, and geospatial analysis, to analyze the data and identify the most promising properties.


### Findings
From 2010 to 2016, the number of housing units has been going up. We saw a drop in the average sale price per square foot in 2011, but the rent still went up that year. Anza Vista's average sale price per square foot in 2016 was less than in 2012. Westwood Park and Merced Heights have the highest rent and highest sale price per square foot, respectively.

Rental income is growing faster than sales prices, but this isn't true everywhere in San Francisco. Some neighborhoods saw sales prices fall while rent went up. For the company's buy-and-rent strategy, Oceanview could be a good place to invest. It has lower prices but is surrounded by expensive homes, so prices could rise as the area develops.
